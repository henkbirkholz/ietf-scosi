1.  Introduction

   SWID tags have several applications including but not limited to:

   o  Software Inventory Management, a part of the Software Asset
      Management [SAM] process, which requires an accurate list of
      discernible deployed software instances.

   o  Vulnerability Assessment, which requires a semantic link between
      standardized vulnerability descriptions and IT-assets.

   o  Remote Attestation, which requires a link between golden (well-
      known) measurements and software instances [I-D.birkholz-tuda].

   SWID tags, as defined in ISO-19770-2:2015 [SWID], provide a
   standardized format for a record that identifies and describes a
   specific release of a software product.  Different software products,
   and even different releases of a particular software product, each
   have a different SWID tag record associated with them.  In addition
   to defining the format of these records, ISO-19770-2:2015 defines
   requirements concerning the SWID tag lifecycle.  Specifically, when a
   software product is installed on an endpoint, that product's SWID tag
   is also installed.  Likewise, when the product is uninstalled or
   replaced, the SWID tag is deleted or replaced, as appropriate.  As a
   result, ISO-19770-2:2015 describes a system wherin there is a
   correspondence between the set of installed software products on an
   endpoint, and the presence on that endpoint of the SWID tags
   corresponding to those products.

   SWID tags are meant to be flexible and able to express a broad set of
   metadata about a software product.  Moreover, there are multiple
   types of SWID tags, each providing different types of information.
   For example, a "media tag" is used to describe an application's
   installation image on an installation media, while a "patch tag" is
   meant to describe a patch that modifies some other application.
   Therefore, the complete set of attributes or types of information
   elements that can be included in a SWID tag often exceeds the scope a
   single application of SWID.

   This document defines a more concise representation of SWID tags in
   the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049].  This is
   described via the CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL)
   [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl].  The resulting Concise SWID
   data definition is interoperable with the XML schema definition of
   ISO-19770-2:2015 [SWID].  The vocabulary, i.e., the CDDL names of the
   types and members used in the Concise SWID data definition, is mapped
   to more concise labels represented as small integers.  The names used
   in the CDDL and the mapping to the CBOR representation using integer
   labels is based on the vocabulary of the attribute and element names
   defined in ISO-19770-2:2015.

   In essence, XML SWID tags are not small, and the use of SWID tags in
   applications can cause a large amount of data to be transported,
   larger than may be acceptable for constrained devices.  Concise SWID
   tags reduce the amount of data transported by using CBOR and maps
   human-readable labels of that content to more concise integer labels
   (indices).

2.  Concise SWID data definition

   This is a complete representation of the content of the ISO-
   19770-2:2015 [SWID] XML schema definition in CDDL.  This
   representation includes all SWID tag fields and thus supports all
   SWID tag use cases.  The CamelCase notation used in the XML schema
   definition is changed to hyphen-separated notation (e.g.
   ResourceCollection is named resource-collection in the Concise SWID
   data definition).  The human-readable names of members are mapped to
   integer indices via a block of rules at the bottom of the Concise
   SWID data definition. 48 character strings of the SWID vocabulary
   that would have to be stored or transported in full if using the
   original vocabulary are replaced.

3.  COSE signatures for Concise SWID tags

   Concise SWID tags require a different signature scheme than the ISO
   SWID tags represented via the XML schema definition.  COSE provides
   the required mechanism [COSE], which will result in additional
   attributes to be included in the general Concise SWID data
   definition, e.g. signature-type ("compat", "cose", etc.).

4.  IANA considerations

   This document will include requests to IANA: Integer indices for SWID
   content attributes and information elements.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO There are: validation, denial of service, counterfeit, etc.
