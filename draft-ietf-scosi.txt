                 Scalable Concise Software Identifiers
                        draft-ietf-scosi-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a concise representation of ISO 19770-2/2015
   Software Identifiers (SWID tags) that is interoperable with the XML
   schema definition of ISO 19770-2/2015.  Additionally, this document
   defines application specific profiles (static subsets) of the
   corresponding vocabulary to enable better scalability in constraint
   environments.

1.  Introduction (TODO 1st draft, rephrase)

   SWID tags have several applications; including but not limited to:

   o  Software Inventory Management, a part of the Software Asset
      Management (SAM) process (TODO REF ISO-19770-5:2013), which
      requires an accurate list of discernible deployed software
      instances.

   o  Vulnerability Assessment, which requires a semantic link between
      standardized vulnerability descriptions and IT-assets.

Internet-Draft                    SCOSI                       March 2016


   o  Remote Attestation, which benefits from an accompanying list of
      golden (well-known) measurements about software.

   Software Identifier tags are meant to be flexible and able to express
   virtually any type of software and their associated metadata.
   Therefore, the complete set of attributes or types of information
   elements that can be included in a Software Identifier tag often
   exceeds the scope a single application of SWID.  Unfortunately, this
   flexibility also limits the capabilities of validation and can
   require a significant amount of resources to cope with its
   consequences.

   As a basis, this documents provides a more concise representation of
   SWID tags in the CBOR [RFC7049] described via the CDDL
   [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl] - the general Concise SWID data
   definition - that is interoperable with the XML schema definition of
   ISO-19770-2:2015 (FIXME someone pls have mercy on this sentence and
   rephrase it).  Derived from this basis, the document defines Concise
   SWID profiles, which are subsets of the general Concise SWID data
   definition structure that represent (in a standardized way) only
   information elements that are required in specific applications.  The
   Concise SWID profile definitions can be completely mapped to the XML
   schema definition of ISO-19770-2:2015 but not vice versa (because
   they are subsets) and do not include anthing equivalent to the XML
   any attribute.

   Additionally, the vocabulary - the names of attributes and
   information elements that are transported as content - used in the
   general Concise SWID data defintion - and corresponding Consise SWID
   profiles - are mapped to a more concise Integer index (FIXME when
   DONE e.g.  "Evidence" is mapped to 42).  A corresponding mapping
   table is registered at the IANA (TODO ref IANA reg).

   In essence, Concise SWID defuse some of the amount of data
   transported by using CBOR, reducing the available vocabulary to
   application-specific content, and mapping human-readable labels for
   that content to more concise indices.  Concise SWID also reduce the
   flexibility of original SWID in order to simplify construction and
   validation of data transported, while remaining easily translatable
   into XML SWID format.

2.  General Concise SWID data definition

   This is a complete representation of the content of the ISO-
   19770-2:2015 XML schema definition in CDDL.  It is possible to use
   this definition as a Concise SWID profile that is fully interoperable
   with the ISO-19770-2:2015 XSD - but it carries the same baggage.

3.  Concise SWID profile applications

   This section highlights (FIXME a number) of profile applications
   Consice SWID profiles are defined for.  A profile can apply to more
   than one profile application and a profile application can result in
   more than one profile.

3.1.  Software Inventory

   The most basic application of Concise SWID tags is a list of every
   discernable software instance installed on an endpoint.  This
   application does require...

3.2.  Vulnerability Assessment

   which attributes and complex types are really essential for
   vulnerability assessment?  This list is so long!

   o  YES: When producing SWID tags, tag creators MUST produce SWID tags
      that conform to all requirements defined in the ISO/IEC
      19770-2:2015 specification.

   o  NO: The <SoftwareIdentity> element MUST specify an @xml:lang
      attribute with a non-blank value to indicate the default human
      language used for expressing all language-dependent attribute
      values.  (TODO CHECK UTF-8 should take care of the problem?)

   o  IDK: Every <Entity> element MUST provide an explicit (i.e., non-
      default) @regid attribute value.  (TODO CHECK, would we need
      this?)

   o  IDK: The <Entity> element containing the @role "tagCreator" MUST
      provide an explicit (i.e., non-default) @regid attribute value.
      (TODO CHECK, would we need this?)

   o  IDK: okay... I'll stop now.  This is US3 from the NISTIR 8060
      requirements v5 spread sheet.

   What is really essential to vulnerabulity assessment here?  This
   includes tpyical optional attributes.  Or is there a problem to
   definde a subset.  Maybe we have to parse every CVE and look for
   attributes it needs to be associated by?

3.3.  Remote Attestation

   insert text here

4.  Mapping of labels and element names

   In order to reduce the general size of a Concise SWID tag, this
   document defines a Concise SWID Mapping Table that translates labels
   and member names used in the general Concise SWID data definition to
   a corresponding integer value.  The type tagID in Figure FIXME, for
   instance, replaces the member composed of label and type in the map.
   This procedure moves the type visible definitions more down in the
   CDD (see Figure FIXME).  The encoding can be detected implicitly, as
   the general Concise SWID data definition uses only strings as labels
   and member names and the reduced mapping only uses integers (FIXME
   this probably requires rephrasing?).  Therefore, encodings can be
   mixed without further indication.

   software-identity = {tagID}

   tagID = (0: text)

5.  Concise SWID profiles

   There is a minimal set of information elements that MUST be included
   in every Concise SWID profile in order to compose a valid SWID tag:
   name, and tagID.  The only exception is the Concise Inventory Item,
   which only consists of a tagID and therefore cannot be translated
   into a valid ISO 19770-2/2015 XML SWID tag.

5.1.  Concise Inventory Item (FIXME cbor tag here)

   The most minimal Concise SWID profile

   software-identity = {tagId: text}


5.2.  Minimal Inventory Item (FIXME cbor tag here)

   The most minimal SWID tag.
