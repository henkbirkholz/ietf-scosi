                 Scalable Concise Software Identifiers
                        draft-ietf-scosi-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a concise representation of ISO 19770-2/2015
   Software Identifiers (SWID tags) that is interoperable with the XML
   schema definition of ISO 19770-2/2015.  Additionally, this document
   defines application specific profiles (static subsets) of the
   corresponding vocabulary to enable better scalability in constraint
   environments.

1.  Introduction (TODO 1st draft, rephrase)

   SWID tags have several applications; including but not limited to:
   Software Inventory Management, a part of the Software Asset
   Management (SAM) process (TODO REF ISO-19770-5:2013), which requires
   an accurate list of discernible deployed software instances.
   Vulnerability Assessment, which requires a semantic link between
   standardized vulnerability descriptions and IT-assets.  Remote
   Attestation, which benefits from an accompanying list of golden
   (well-known) measurements about software.

   Software Identifier (SWID) tags are meant to be flexible and able to
   express virtually any type of software and their associated metadata.
   Therefore, the complete set of attributes or types of information
   elements that can be included in a Software Identifier tag often
   exceeds the scope a single application of SWID.  Unfortunately, this
   flexibility also limits the capabilities of validation and can
   require a significant amount of resources to cope with its
   consequences.

   As a basis, this documents provides a more concise representation of
   SWID tags in the CBOR [RFC7049] described via the CDDL
   [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl] - the general Concise SWID data
   definition - that is interoperable with the XML schema definition of
   ISO-19770-2:2015 (FIXME someone pls have mercy on this sentence and
   rephrase it).  Derived from this basis, the document defines Concise
   SWID profiles, which are subsets of the general Concise SWID data

   definition structure that represent (in a standardized way) only
   information elements that are required in specific applications.  The
   Concise SWID profile defintions can be completely mapped to the XML
   schema definition of ISO-19770-2:2015 but not vice versa (because
   they are subsets).

   Additionally, the vocabulary - the names of attributes and
   information elements that are transported as content - used in the
   general Concise SWID data defintion - and corresponding Consise SWID
   profiles - are mapped to a more concise Integer index (FIXME when
   DONE e.g.  "Evidence" is mapped to 42).  A corresponding mapping
   table is registered at the IANA (ref IANA reg).

   In essence, Concise SWID defuse some of the amount of data
   transported by using CBOR, reducing the available vocabulary to
   application-specific content, and mapping human-readable labels for
   that content to more concise indices.  Concise SWID also reduce the
   flexibility of original SWID in order to simplify construction and
   validation of data transported, while remaining easily translatable
   into XML SWID format.
